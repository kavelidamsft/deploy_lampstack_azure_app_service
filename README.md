# Deploy a LAMP App to Azure Action

## Description

This GitHub Action automates the deployment of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack on an App Service (App). The action provisions the App and deploys the LAMP stack using an ARM template and parameter file.

This template uses the Azure Linux CustomScript extension to deploy a LAMP application on Ubuntu. It creates an Ubuntu VM, does a silent install of MySQL, Apache and PHP, then creates a simple PHP script. Go to /phpinfo.php to see the deployed page.
